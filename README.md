# echolocation
Reinventing the wheel - one chip at a time. Sensing the nearest object within 69cm in a 180 degree arc, using echolocation. An echolocation device that self-tests to set a sensitivity level then chirps a 10khz signal and times the reflections to a microphone attached to a peak comparator circuit. It then lights up Neopixel LEDs to indicate distance of the nearest object.

next step: add more mics and triangulate!
