# echolocation
Reinventing the wheel - one chip at a time. An echolocation device that chirps a 10khz signal and times the reflections to 3 mics. It then lights up Neopixel LEDs to indicate angle, distance and size of the nearest object. 

Sensing and returning values to point a ray at the nearest object within 69cm in a 180 degree arc, using echolocation. Lighting a half ring of x leds to show direction, distance (with brightness) and how large the object is by lighting more than one led.
